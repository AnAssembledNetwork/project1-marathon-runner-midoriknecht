# Marathon Runner
A program that can be used by marathon runners who are planning to run in the Tokyo marathon that converts miles to km/min to find their pace and USD to Japanese yen. It asks for their name, how many miles they can run in ten minutes, and how many US dollars they have. It then returns the users pace in km/min and how much money they in Japanese yen.
